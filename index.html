        Beginner web developer with a background in retail and bicycle mechanics. To learn HTML, CSS and Javascript I have run through the CodeCademy tracks of the aforementioned, solved kata on codewars to improve my Javascript algorithm scripting and begun working through FreeCodeCamp's Front End Development certification. I have started to learn Git as well, using GitHub pages to make this webapp. I am in early stages but seeking experience and personal and professional development.<br>
        From my experience working at Lush (famed for its impeccable customer service) and teaching people to fix their own bicycles at the not-for-profit project "London Bike Kitchen" I have fantastic communication skills and can work through problem solving with others. I enjoy making complex things work and logically working through problems which is why I am making the transition to web development.<br>
        In my spare time I enjoy cycling, particularly ultra-distance racing, placing 10th in The Transatlantic Way - a 2500km single stage bicycle race around Ireland.
